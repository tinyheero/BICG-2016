# BiCG (2016) - Copy Number and Single Nucleotide Labs

This is the material for the copy number alternation (CNA) and single nucleotide labs for the [Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops - Bioinformatics for Cancer Genomics 2016 workshop](http://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/2016/bioinformatics-cancer-genomics-2016). 

## Copy Number Alteration Lab (Module 5)

This lab will provide hands-on exercises using CNA caller tool for CNA detection in SNP arrays and sequencing data.

The material for the copy number can be found in the `cnas` folder.

* `cnas/content`: Content for the lab
* `cnas/scripts`: Scripts to be used in the lab

If you are interested in the specific details on how to install software used in the lab, please see the `cnas/content/cna-installation.md`.

## Somatic Single Nucleotide Mutations (Module 6)

This lab will provide hands on lab exercises using calling tools for somatic mutation detection and visualization in [IGV](https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/)
